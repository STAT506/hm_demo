1. Simulate data from a "random slopes, random intercept" model framework.



2. Create a plot that displays the simulated data, in this figure ignore the groups. 


3. Now create a figure (faceted and/or colored) that highlights the group differences.


4. Fit the model and compare the estimated values with simulated values
